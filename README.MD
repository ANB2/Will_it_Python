Will it Python?
===============

Introduction
------------
_Will it Python?_ programs are ports of data analyses originally done in R into Python. The projects are accompanied by a series of blog posts documenting the porting-process. See http://slendrmeans.wordpress.com/will-it-python for more information.

Projects:
---------
The code is organized into subfolders by translation project. The projects so far are:

1. MLFH: _Machine Learning for Hackers_ by Drew Conway and John Myles White.

Software:
---------
The code is written for Python 2.7. Third party libraries used in projects are:
    - Numpy 1.6.1
    - Scipy 0.10.0
    - Matplotlib 1.1.0
    - Pandas 0.7.3

I'm also using IPython 0.12 to create the IPython notebooks.

IPython Notebooks:
------------------
I'll aim to maintain for each project both a Python script that replicates the R analysis (a .py file), and an annotated IPython notebook (a .pynb file). This will contain the same code as the Python script, but will contain more explicit commenting and discussion, and will perhaps be easier for interactive/exploratory use.
